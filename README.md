# Simple Upload Server with `Node.js` and [@formidable](https://github.com/node-formidable/formidable)

This project is a simple web server which uses `formidable` to save the uploaded files and is capable of performing handling requests asynchronously.

This project is the result after two days of learning nodjs from different resources and books mainly `The Node Beginner Book` written by [@manuelkiessling](https://github.com/manuelkiessling) and translated by [@msudgh](https://github.com/msudgh/) into persian. I've read the translated version, thanks to [@msudgh](https://github.com/msudgh/).

This project is a more complete version of the final project of the mentioned book.

I used the following resources:

* `The Node Beginner`
* [w3school](https://www.w3schools.com/)
